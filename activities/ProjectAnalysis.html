		<h2>Site Intent</h2>
		<p>Aleta's Archive will be a fan site for the upcoming digital card game Infinity Wars.  Aleta's Archive will serve as a place where players can research cards and build, browse, share and review deck ideas.  The interface will be clean and will react contextually.</p>
	</section>
		<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
		<p>Infinity Wars is currently in its closed beta pages so there are few direct competitors for Aleta's Archive at this time.  However I was able to find a few sites that serve a somewhat similar purpose for the card game Magic: The Gathering.  These sites are: www.coolstuffinc.com and www.mtgfanatic.com.  Both of these sites have a retail focus where Aleta's Archive does and use keywords such as "buy" and "card sleeves" however they also have "deck containing [insert card name]" or keywords that are direct card names.  Both sites are used primarily by males between the ages of 18 and 34.</p>

		<h2>Target Audience</h2>
		<p>The target audience will be generally players of the game Infinity Wars.  Aleta's Archive will facilitate a couple different activities.  Below are a few example use cases:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>User Jeremy is looking for a card with "Aleta" in its name.  Jeremy uses the search bard in the global navigation to do a basic search for the word "aleta".  The site then shows the user Aleta, Immortal Tinkerer and Aleta Immortal Sorceress.  Jeremey notices both cards have an "exhaust" ability and is curious about other cards with similar abilities so he conducts a detailed search looking for "Exhaust" in the card text.</li>
			<li>User Veronica stumbled across a great combination of cards and would like to share the idea with others and gets feedback.  Veronica creates a builds a new deck containing her inventive combination and posts it for others to view.  Other users come across her deck while browsing and give the deck a star rating and comment on the deck's strengths and weaknesses. </li>
		</ul>
